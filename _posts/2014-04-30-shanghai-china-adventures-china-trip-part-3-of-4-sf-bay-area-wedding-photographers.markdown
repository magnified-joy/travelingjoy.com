<p>We've arrive in Shanghai via another sleeper train from Xian. Shanghai is a very modern city, it is the economic center of China. Transportation from the train station to our hotel was easy. </p>

<p>A view outside of our hotel - the Astor House Hotel. This is the oldest hotel in Shanghai, rich in history and character. Kinda swanky!  </p>

<p>A view of our room, looks just like a scene from old Shanghai movies! The view is pretty great from our window. As you can probably already tell, Shanghai is very westernized. A lot of the buildings are all victorian style. There were a few moments where I forgot we were technically still in China. Shanghai just got a very different vibe to itself.</p>

<p>Some famous people have stayed in this hotel in the past. Albert Einstein in 1922, U.S. President Grant in 1879, Charlie Chaplin in 1931 and 1936, English philosopher Bertrand Russell in 1920. Just to name a few.</p>

<p>The picture Maria is looking at here is the painting showing that the Astor House was the first in Shanghai to have electricity! </p>

<p>Bride sighting! If you're thinking of a destination wedding in Shanghai, don't forget to take us along!</p>

<p>Unfortunately Shanghai also has an air pollution problem. However in this photo, it gave it a very futuristic look. Looks like this could be a scene in a Star Trek movie!</p>

<p>I really liked the countdown timer on the stop light. It shows how many seconds left before it changes color. Why don't we see that more often elsewhere?</p>

<p>The Pearl Tower. Looks cool, but kinda useless use of space in my opinion.</p>

<p>Here's our view from the restaurant we ate at for lunch - South Beauty is the name. Pretty spectacular view!</p>

<p>A few pics of our food. Did we mentioned we are foodies?</p>

<p>We stopped though the "old Shanghai" where we see some of the traditional Chinese buildings. </p>

<p>It's hairy crab season in Shanghai. We didn't try any after seeing some of the water conditions in China. We don't really trust seafood from China. Looks cool though! </p>

<p>Shanghai got to where it is today due to it's location, it was a trade/port city. This canal was probably heavily used for trading back in the day. </p>

<p>Here's a street view that is slightly less westernized (Above). And here is one that is slightly more westernized (Below).</p>

<p>We walked the streets a little bit and grabbed lunch before we grab our taxi to the airport to our next adventure.</p>

<p>Lunchcam. Noodles and dumplings. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, pollution was pretty bad that day. Millions of people trapped under here. </p>

<p>One of the most powerful photo I've taken in my life! This is the clear border as we're rising from the polluted air to clean air. There are blue skies above the pollution. Just really sad how humanity will sacrifice health of human race in order to "get ahead".</p>
