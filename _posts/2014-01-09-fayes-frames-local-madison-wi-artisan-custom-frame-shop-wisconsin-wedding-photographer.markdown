<p>We receive so many packages at our home that it didn't phase me when I got home today to see a package sitting at the bottom of our stairs. Without free hands to grab it right away, I told En Tao, "I think your package arrived."<br />
He went down the stairs to claim it, and said, "Well, I didn't order it, but it's ours."<br />
- "What do you mean, you didn't order it?"<br />
- "I didn't order it, but it has our names on it.<br />
I was a bit puzzled.<br />
- "It's from that new vendor!" Before even unwrapping the package, En Tao got bubbly like a kid with a new toy. He showed me the return address label of "Faye's Frames" and said, "I just Liked their page a few weeks ago. They are a new local frame vendor."<br />
Then I got bubbly like a kid with a Christmas gift.<br />
I peeked into the box before En Tao could and found a beautifully wrapped package with a sprig of evergreen + berries and a branded note from Faye's Frames: </p>
<p>"We are a local Wisconsin based creative small business, a husband & wife duo who see beauty in the unexpected."</p>
<p>So beautiful indeed! Best of all, En Tao got to unwrap the new product--a beautiful artisan frame! This high-quality frame is made from authentic reclaimed barn boards, how cool! I love that each frame is unique in color and texture due to nature of the old, rustic wood that is used. </p>
<p>We are so incredibly thankful and impressed that we get to work with other amazing wedding vendors and creatives like Faye's Frames. We thank you for your gift, Amanda + Matthew, and wish you many blessings as you <b>grow</b> and <b>showcase</b> your partner businesses, <a href="http://alluringblooms.com/">Alluring Blooms</a> + <a href="http://www.fayesframes.com"</a>Faye's Frames</a>. </p>
