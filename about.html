           <h1 style="margin-top:0"> Maria & En Tao</h1><p>
With a background in IT, En Tao was itching to use his creative brain. He worked for a while in commercial photography and IT network administration and found that he enjoyed the technical and artistic aspects of photography. He started to delve more seriously into his photo hobby, and eventually decided to turn this passion into his vocation.</p><p>

Maria, on the other hand, has a passion for connecting with individuals across cultures and creative projects. She traveled the world, studied multiple languages, and found that she had a knack for bringing out people’s brightest personalities behind the camera lens. It was only natural that she would end up as a professional photographer.</p><p>

Maria and En Tao met in the light of a campfire in their college years, after Maria returned from a year in China. They instantly connected as friends because of their multicultural backgrounds and love for culinary experimentation. He helped her with her Mandarin lessons, she taught him to ballroom dance. Together, they took lots and lots of pictures.</p><p>

Their decision to launch Magnified Joy Photography came from a less than desirable outcome from their own wedding photos. They thought they were doing the right thing by saving money in the budget line of photography, but consequently both the service from their photographer and the resulting photos were disappointing. Compromising on their photography budget meant compromising on the level of experience, service, and quality and style of their final images. This became the biggest regret of their wedding. This motivated En Tao + Maria to become the photographers that they didn’t get to hire. They sought out to give other couples a positive experience in all the things that they felt they missed out on at their own wedding.
</p><p>
So they set out to give other couples a better experience. And Magnified Joy Photography was born.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top:0">Together as a team, Maria and En Tao make up Magnified Joy Photography. </h2>
<p>We are not your average wedding photographers. We are a traveling husband and wife team that care as much about your marriage as the quality of your photography experience on your wedding day.</p>

<p>We take an organic approach to wedding and engagement photography. We take the initiative to make sure your day will flow as smoothly as possible with ongoing communication throughout your engagement as well as getting together to plan and discuss your wedding day timeline several weeks before your wedding. When your wedding day arrives, you will feel confident about our approach, as we naturally and sincerely interact with you and your guests. We take great joy in getting to build relationships with every one of our clients, and their families and friends, and consider it a huge privilege to be entrusted to photograph one of the greatest days of your lives. For us, Magnified Joy Photography is far more than just shooting a wedding. It’s an organic experience. It’s capturing the details and emotions. It’s beautifully curated storytelling. But most of all, it’s sincere relationships. </p>
