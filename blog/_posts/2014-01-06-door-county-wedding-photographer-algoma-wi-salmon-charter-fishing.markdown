<p>A 4am wakeup call is never easy, but usually rewarding. (The last time I got up this early was when En Tao spontaneously woke me up to go and climb the tallest mountain in Colorado--on top of which he proposed to me! I can tell you our engagement story sometime.) So yes, early mornings are hard, but good. This morning wasn't nearly as breathtaking as a mountain-top proposal, but it was a beautiful and serene sunrise on the lake and a hard working-adventure of reeling in our prized Lake Michigan salmon.</p>

<p>Our family has a tradition of going charter fishing on Lake Michigan at least once a summer. Since En Tao has joined our family, I have enjoyed this tradition even more, as we find a way to connect with my dad via his love language of spending time in the outdoors. </p>

<p>Even though my dad usually sets up the charter fishing for us, ironically, he is usually the one that does the least amount of work. That is, he enjoys watching us struggle with hanging on to the long fishing pole while using all of our abdominal and bicep strength to reel in the 10+ pound fish from yards and yards away. Boy, do they get heavy! </p>

<p>En Tao also helps me reel in the big fish, a tag-team effort, as it can be really exhausting to do it on your own (think, limp, shaky arms)! We take great enjoyment in charter fishing, leaving the hard part of setting up the gear to our captain and his boatman, but getting to catch our own food! We also have fun documenting the adventure, too.</p>

<p>We enjoy just hanging out on the boat together, getting to spend intentional time connecting with my brother Ben and his girlfriend, Sarah, too. (Ben and I share other family traditions too, as you can view <a href="http://weddings.magnifiedjoy.com/life/madison-wi-wedding-photographer-booyah-a-taste-of-green-bay-culture-in-madison-chicken-stew/">Ben's Booyah here</a>.)</p>

<p>And, it's a catch! </p>

<p>They look deceivingly small in the water, but they are actually quite long and heavy fish.</p>

<p>Now, my turn! I like the adrenaline rush of catching a fish.<br />

<p>En Tao was quite proud of his.<br />

<p>Time for cleaning and claiming our catches. Good thing the boatman does this part for us. We take great enjoyment in watching the seagulls flocking immediately to the boat, trying to fly and keep up with the boat, fighting for unwanted scraps of salmon as they're flung into the air. Can you spot the seagull catching a piece in his beak?</p>
