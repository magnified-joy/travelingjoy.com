<p>You know that smell? You know, the one of autumn. It’s as if the leaves were perspiring and giving off their unique adolescent scent. Their changing colors shows off their confidence, knowing that their peak beauty is vibrant yet fleeting. It’s that smell and the accompanying colors of the leaves that plucks a string in the chord of my heart. Oh yes, my heart melts with the autumn beauty.</p>

<p>To go all out in this love affair, I head straight “up north.” For those in Madison, Green Bay seems “up north.” But for those of us Green Bay natives, well, “up north” really means up north! That’s right, the northwoods of Wisconsin is what I’m talking about. En Tao and I retreat four hours north of Madison to a special cabin in Mercer, WI on a prime piece of property on Lake Trude. Here, I can indulge in my autumn affair. Not only do the rainbow of fall colors mesmerize me, but it’s the collective fall scene that helps me to disconnect from city life, focus on God, rejuvenate, and jump-start again in our business and life goals.</p>

<p>It’s here that I can actually focus on picking up a book and reading it. It’s here that I can lay on a flannel blanket in the leaves and just admire the leaves dancing above me and the water ripple with unique patterns in front of me. It’s here that I am captivated by God’s colors, sounds, and smells, uninterrupted and undistracted. It’s here that I check my phone only to tell me the time of sunset and know how much time I have to spend outside and simply enjoy it all</p>

<p>While at the cabin, En Tao and I put on our comfy pajama pants and cuddle up next to the fireplace with a fresh cup of coffee. Here we begin our Magnified Joy Photography planning for the next year with intentional prayer time and a notepad, trusting God with big dreams and making action steps to see these dreams come to fruition. We dream of how we can better love and serve our clients, how we can continue on in excellence and art, how we can become an inspiration and resource for other photographers.</p>

<p>We are incredibly thankful and blessed by the Ederer family’s generosity of allowing us to use their cabin for our newly annual October planning retreat.</p>
