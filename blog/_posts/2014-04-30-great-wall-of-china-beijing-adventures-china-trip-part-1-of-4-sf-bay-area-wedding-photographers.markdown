<p>We had an opportunity to photograph our first international wedding in Hong Kong last year. After the wedding, we figured since we are on this side of the world, might as well do some personal travel. We've invited Maria's mom to travel with us, it's her first time to Asia. Both Maria and I have been to China in the past, we've both been to Beijing ourselves. Since both Maria and I have been to Beijing before, we decided to spend less time here and spend more time in other parts of the country. The Great Wall of China is just a short drive from the city center. Since this is mom's first time to China, this stop is a must!</p>
<p>Traveling across China can be difficult logistically. However, since both Maria and I speak Chinese, we were able to speak to the locals and get around the city.   </p>

<p>Unfortunately the "fog" that you see is not fog, but spilled over air pollution from city center. This is actually considered to be a low/moderate pollution day. Last time I was here, I could not see 20 ft in front of me. I'm glad we were able to see some landscape during this trip.</p>

<p>The wall was built a long long time ago on the old border of China and Mongolia. Which is not the same as the current country border. I'm not going to bore you with a history lessons, if you are interested in learning more, here's the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China">wikipedia article on the Great Wall</a>.</p>

<p>This last picture of the Great Wall is actually made of 38 images. Look closely and you will see the Great Wall. I want to print this photo full size someday. Full size photo would measure 7.5ft wide. If anyone interested in buying a full size print of this photo for their home, let me know :)</p>
<p>Pro tip: Schedule a private taxi to get you to the Great Wall early in the morning. This particular Great Wall entrance is Mu Tian Yu entrance, which took 1.5hrs to get to from city center if memory serves me correctly. When you go early before the tour buses, you miss the crowds, better for photos. Also on the way down after your hike, you ride a toboggan down the hill. Not so fun when lots of people are in line or using the toboggan run, because then you're usually stuck behind someone who is afraid to go fast and spoil your fun in going down the toboggan fast. </p>

<p>We spent some time in the old part of Beijing - Hutong. This is a section of the city that still has the original infrastructure and not modern day skyscrapers. We followed Lonely Planet recommendation on a route through Hutong. Without a guidebook, you can easily get lost as alleyways start looking the same. Parts of the route looks like we're entering into someone's home, but it's actually a public path. One of the last stops on this route was the home of one of the last emperor where he grew up. Kinda cool! Hutong's setup is like an onion, it's made of different rings/layers of homes.</p>

<p>Maria and her mom. On the stick there is a common street snack found in China. It's haw berries and clementines on a stick, dipped in sugar, then hardened. </p>

<p>The inner parts of hutong are still civilian homes. The outer ring has now turn mostly into little gift shops, restaurants and tourist traps.</p>

<p>Sometimes, even knowing the language, we are still faced with surprises. This is Maria's reaction to how gigantic the bowl of noodles is. </p>

<p>We spent some time walking the streets of San Li Tun, which is known for its shops. This is where you go to go to the malls, walk the streets and visit different street vendors. </p>

<p>This is also where you would go to find foreign foods. Mexican food for instance. </p>

<p>We spent a couple of days in Beijing then we are off to the next city on our list -- Xian. The city known for it's Terracotta Warriors. How we get there from Beijing to save time is by riding a sleeper train. Here you see a picture of Maria at the train terminal with the train schedules on the LED board. As you can tell from the board, there are trains going all different directions. It is not uncommon to see train terminals just as big if bigger than most airport terminals here in the US. </p>

<p>By taking the sleeper train, you leave at night (roughly 9pm), sleep overnight on the train, then wake up at your destination (~10 am). </p>
