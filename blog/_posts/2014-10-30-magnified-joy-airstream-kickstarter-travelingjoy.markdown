Join the U.S. Adventure with Airstream Wedding Photographers. We are launching our Kickstarter project to acquire this beautiful fully renovated 1961 Airstream Safari as our mobile headquarter will allow us to work more sustainably on the road as we capture peopleâ€™s unique love stories all across the U.S.

This little illustration is a very simplified version of Magnified Joy's story this year. Since we got our Prius in December of 2013, we have put in 29,000+ miles on our Prius (nicknamed Evie). (note: that's more than the circumference of earth; 24,901 miles)

You can learn more about the airstream (nicknamed Runaround Sue) at the [New Prairie Construction's website.](http://www.newprairieconstruction.com/airstream)

We also had the chance to interview Julie, who is the president of New Prairie Construction:
