<p>My brother was the one growing up who repeatedly ordered his burgers “just plain.”</p>
<p>--“Ketchup, mustard, pickles, lettuce, onion, cheese?”</p>
<p>--“Just plain. Meat and bun. Thank you.”</p>
<p>It’s hard to believe this same boy is now one of my foodie inspirations, as he creates some of the most unique, wholesome, and tasty food that I know. His eagerness to learn, his creativity, and his humble nature to impress no-one, has also rightfully earned him a page in this month’s <a href="http://www.madisonmagazine.com/Madison-Magazine/October-2013/Much-Deserved-Praise-for-Forequarter/">Madison Magazine</a>, representing one of Madison’s best restaurants, Forequarter. His ingenuity and food skills extend far beyond his restaurant duties though. Ben Blohoweak has led the way in carrying on one of our food traditions growing up in Green Bay--booyah--and carried that passion to share it with others in Madison, where we both now reside.</p>
<p>I was surprised when I started asking my Madisonian friends if they’ve ever heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booyah_(stew)">booyah</a>, only to respond, “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booyah_(stew)">BOOYAH</a>!” with a verbal punch. I said, “Yes, you’re right, but have you ever tried the food?” With a confused look on their face I began to understand that my friends only knew of booyah as a verbal exclamation rather than the rich tradition of the amazing chicken stew that I was referring to. I had assumed that booyah was an Upper Midwestern tradition! I began finding out that only people north of the Fox Cities, in the counties of Brown, Outagamie, etc. really knew what I was referring to! I started to do some research, and along with a well-written article by <a href="http://m.isthmus.com/article.php?article=30642">Terese Allen</a>, I now understand that booyah was very much a smaller regional cuisine that I thought.</p>
<p>In light of that, I was so happy that my brother was going to capitalize on this idea and actually bring booyah to Madison! Not that he was trying to make any money at all, but rather, simply wanting to share the love of this Belgian tradition of ours with friends, Ben set off to make a BIG ‘ol batch of booyah.<br />

<p>Booyah is no small affair. It starts off with a generous pot, one that does not fit on your kitchen stove, but rather, outside with a separate heating source and pipes. My dad’s connections in Green Bay helped him score a hand-crafted stainless steel booyah kettle, a “smaller-sized” one of 18 gallons. My dad transported the 18-gallon kettle to Madison on the back of his truck to Ben’s neighborhood on the east side of Madison.</p>

<p>Booyah is also a communal affair. Ben and his girlfriend, Sarah, purchased five whole chickens from a local provider, gathered up a variety of root vegetables from the Dane County farmer’s market, and defrosted venison meat from last year’s kill. Another friend donated a generous amount of carrots from their CSA and their time chopping all the vegetables. Another friend helped chop the wood to furnish a large fire in the bottom of the kettle, to get the coals going for several hours of intense heat. After baking the chickens and de-boning them, Ben started on making the broth base in the kettle with the bones and spices. Sarah started baking a fine apple kuchen and several Belgian pies.</p>

<p>Hours later, the rain was drizzling and the sun had set. The booyah had been stewing for hours, simmering the unique juices of the meat--chicken, venison, and beef pieces--with the spices and veggies--garlic, carrots, peas, celery, onions, potatoes and tomatoes. The booyah was set! Ben stirred the soup in the kettle with a long hand-carved wooden ladle (that he made the night before) and started dishing some out. He generously served others before himself, just delighted to share his days-worth of preparation and love!</p>
<p>“Make sure you put some oyster crackers on top too. That’s how we ate it growing up!”</p>

<p>And with the bowl of booyah in hand and a tap beer at one’s side, a multitude of friends gathered, ate, and celebrated!</p>

<p>After the booyah, a unique Belgian dessert was expected to follow the meal. Sarah’s first attempt at making Belgian pies--a light fluffy dough, prune filling, and a sweet cream cheese/cottage cheese mixture on top--was perfectly accurate of our Aunt Clara’s decades old practice of making the traditional Belgian pies!</p>

<p>I am so thankful that Ben and Sarah have generously devoted their time, resources, and love to share this special childhood tradition of booyah with our friends in Madison. Growing up, I naively thought that Green Bay didn’t have much of a culture beyond the obvious Green Bay Packers football obsession, but now I know we have something to share from our local ancestors. We still don’t know exactly how booyah came about, but we can be happy to say that it has French (booyah comes from the French words "to boil" or "broth") and Belgian roots and is focused on celebrating the harvest bounty and the community to make it all happen.</p>
