<p>This all started because I wanted to plan a surprise birthday trip for En Tao's birthday. I had a few goals in mind: I wanted to escape the Wisconsin winter for a few days; I wanted to use our United flight voucher to fly somewhere in the U.S.; I wanted to go somewhere fun that we've never been before; and I wanted to find a location that allowed both adventure and relaxation. </p>
<p>I started searching for a fun and accessible (with an established airport) city in the lower U.S. states. I remember hearing great things about <a href="http://www.itsatrip.org/">Albuquerque</a> from one of my friends. I knew that there was great culture, great food, and (compared to WI this time of year) great weather. It was certainly accessible and seemed to offer a lot of fun things to do both in the city and the surrounding natural outdoors (Sandia Mountains, National Petroglyphs, etc.). I started searching for a place to stay within the city limits so that we could easily tour around the city and rely on public transportation if we needed to. </p>
<p>As I was searching online and trying my best to stay away from chain hotels, I surprisingly stumbled upon exactly what I was looking for--a historic inn and cultural center. This bed and breakfast was fantastically located in a great neighborhood of the city, nestled between various horse farms and smaller boutique shops and restaurants, yet perfectly secluded on its own organic lavender and farm fields. The moment I found <a href="http://www.lospoblanos.com/">Los Poblanos' website</a> I was convinced by its entire experience--but namely the beautifully simple and well-designed rooms with keva fireplaces and its fresh, organic, local and unique food presentations. Everything about the first look at <a href="http://www.lospoblanos.com/">Los Poblanos' website</a> sold me. I knew that this would be the ideal place for En Tao and I to spend a short four day fun and relaxing vacation in <a href="http://www.itsatrip.org/">Albuquerque</a>. </p>
<p>Even before we arrived, I kept re-typing Los Poblanos into my browser to distract me from the dreary Wisconsin winter and delightfully anticipate our stay at such a promising venue. I was falling in love with this place that I hadn't even seen in person yet. It was so hard to keep my mouth closed about the awesome surprise that I had planned for En Tao! </p>

<p>When we finally landed in Albuquerque, after a flight cancellation and several succeeding plane delays due to snow, I was thankful to have received a phone call from <a href="http://www.lospoblanos.com">Los Poblanos</a> to make sure that we were ok. What a welcoming feeling to know that our Inn keepers were so hospitable and concerned for our arrival.  </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2324" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 03" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-03.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>Even though not in bloom, the lavender fields greeted us to the Los Poblanos property!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2325" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 04" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-04.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>The sun radiating off the Los Poblanos main building was warmly captivating. To us coming from a white and grey snowy drab in Wisconsin the colors were so rich and enticing.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2326" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 05" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-05.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>The porch leaves us with the impression to come sit down and take in the New Mexican culture. </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2327" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 06" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-06.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2328" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 07" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-07.jpg" width="1500" height="758" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2329" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 08" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-08.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>Our room speaks for itself. Stunningly. Simple. </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2330" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 09" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-09.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>I love that Los Poblanos staff provided us with fresh firewood each day to make a small fire in our keva (fireplace). The perfect way to set a relaxing and romantic tone. Each evening we cuddled up in bed and fell asleep to the soothing crackling noises and flickering flames. </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2331" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 10" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-10.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>The unique tile floor in the bathroom.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2332" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 11" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-11.jpg" width="1500" height="758" /></p>
<p>Fresh fruit basket to greet us and a personalized Happy Birthday card to En Tao from Los Poblanos. Knowing how popular <a href="http://www.ediblecommunities.com/">Edible magazine</a> is here in Madison, we definitely took note of the Edible magazine Santa Fe & Albuquerque edition.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2333" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 12" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-12.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>Speaking of food, we were excited to see the Los Poblanos team preparing our first meal at the Inn. </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2334" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 13" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-13.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>Sunshine streaming in the seating area, inviting us to come in and wake up to some awesome <a href="http://www.lospoblanos.com/food-and-dining/dine-with-us/inn-breakfast/">breakfast</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2335" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 14" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-14.jpg" width="1500" height="1183" /></p>
<p>First things first. Enjoying a fresh cup of <a href="http://www.villamyriam.com/">Villa Myriam</a> Colombian organic coffee. </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2336" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 15" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-15.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>Perfectly ripe mangoes and pears with a side of fresh homemade pound cake. </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2337" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 16" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-16.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>After consuming my fruit, pound cake, coffee, and homemade granola, I wasn't sure I would even have room for the breakfast entree! Shamelessly we ordered one of each of the two offerings so that we could split it and fully enjoy Los Poblanos' well known <a href="http://www.lospoblanos.com/food-and-dining/dine-with-us/inn-breakfast/">breakfasts</a>. One entree was a cheesy polenta topped with fresh microgreens grown at LP's greenhouse and a side of sausage.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2338" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 17" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-17.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>The second entree was Los Poblanos Migas with tortilla strips, scrambled eggs and white cheddar cheese, topped with their own microgreens, and a side of Kyzer Farms breakfast sausage. There was definitely nothing short of the <a href="http://www.lospoblanos.com/food-and-dining/dine-with-us/inn-breakfast/">"full organic gourmet breakfast"</a> that Los Poblanos promised us!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2339" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 18" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-18.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>After breakfast we meandered through the property, making sure that we took a walk through Los Poblanos' greenhouse to see all those microgreens that they were growing. We had the pleasure to meet the two hardworking farmers, Kyle and Will, who explained to us a little bit about their seedlings, their lavender yields, and their farming techniques in this desert region. I was amazed to find out how sustainable they are with such little rainfall each year. </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2340" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 19" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-19.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>Checking out all the different kinds of seedlings.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2341" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 20" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-20.jpg" width="1500" height="1183" /></p>
<p>Gorgeous greens!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2342" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 21" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-21.jpg" width="1500" height="1060" /></p>
<p>Later as we continued strolling through the property we saw Kyle and Will working on the few remaining rows of greens growing out in the fields. What a contrast to the Wisconsin snow-covered fields awaiting their spring debut. To see greens thriving both in the greenhouse and from the ground made me smile!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2343" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 22" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-22.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn't get this guy's name, but his stunning presence kept charming us during our stay.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2344" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 23" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-23.jpg" width="1500" height="758" /></p>
<p>We loved everything about the Los Poblanos farm experience, from the twin silos and old tractor to the red chili ristas and stacks of hundreds of mini flower pots to iconic friendly golden farm kitten. </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2345" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 24" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-24.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2346" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 25" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-25.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>And how about these two just hanging out? </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2347" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 26" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-26.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>And this adventurous goat?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2348" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 27" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-27.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>And the friendly brown cow, too. </p>
<p>Los Poblanos was a model experimental farm in the 1930s and 1940s. It was home to the original Creamland Dairies, and supplied Albuquerque with a considerable portion of its milk. It boasted one of the finest purebred herds of Guernsey and Holstein cows in the Southwest and played a significant role in building up the dairy industry in New Mexico.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2349" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 28" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-28.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>We spent a fair amount of time in the <a href="http://www.lospoblanos.com/thefarmshop/">Farm Shop</a> admiring all of the wonderfully selected items. </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2350" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 29" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-29.jpg" width="1500" height="570" /></p>
<p>I was particularly interested in all of the Los Poblanos items--the tasty housemade granola that we had at breakfast, the lavender essential oils, soaps, lotions, and lip salve, and the other Los Poblanos screen printed aprons and napkins. </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2351" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 30" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-30.jpg" width="1500" height="758" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2352" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 31" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-31.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2353" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 32" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-32.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>As morning eased on, the mountains beyond Los Poblanos property seemed to be visibly more present and beckoned us to explore more of Albuquerque.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2354" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 33" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-33.jpg" width="1500" height="810" /></p>
<p>I was so excited to take out the bicycle cruisers that Los Poblanos provided their guests. Since I work at a food co-op in Wisconsin, I already had in mind that I wanted to stop by <a href="http://www.lamontanita.coop/">La Montanita, Albuquerque's food co-op</a>, only about a mile or so down the road from their property. We made sure to pick up some local products, including fresh apple spearmint juice, kombucha, and Toas granola bars, and connected with the cashier about his favorite places in Albuquerque, before hopping back on our bikes to explore <a href="http://www.albuquerqueoldtown.com/">Old Town</a>. Later in the day we made sure to swing by <a href="http://www.thegrovecafemarket.com/">The Grove Market & Cafe</a> for a late lunch then drove to the base of <a href="http://www.sandiapeak.com/">Sandia Mountains</a> to take the tram up to the top. The view of Albuquerque was amazing both before sunset and also once the night light city scape emerged. </p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2355" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 34" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-34.jpg" width="1500" height="1183" /></p>
<p>After making our way back to Los Poblanos, the evening lights of the Inn greeted us with a different appeal--romantic and relaxing. We were excited about our dinner at <a href="http://www.lospoblanos.com/food-and-dining/dine-with-us/la-merienda/">La Merienda</a>. We ordered a field greens salad with beets, the short ribs, and the chicken ballantine. En Tao was super impressed with the short ribs and said the beef just melted in his mouth!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2356" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 35" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-35.jpg" width="1500" height="758" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2357" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 36" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-36.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2358" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 37" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-37.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2359" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 38" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-38.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>Our second full day at Los Poblanos was just as fantastic. Again the sun beating off the buildings was warmly beautiful and awakening.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2360" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 39" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-39.jpg" width="1500" height="1183" /></p>
<p>The white peacock sat perched in the large tree in front of the Historic Inn main building as if he was watch-keeper and welcome staff. The colorful hot air balloon rose in the distance over the property and reminded me of Albuquerque's love for hot air balloons. (Albuquerque hosts the <a href="http://www.balloonfiesta.com/">world's largest hot air balloon festival</a> every year in October.) </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2361" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 40" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-40.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2362" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 41" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-41.jpg" width="1500" height="758" /></p>
<p>The farm breakfast menu that changes daily and the housemade granola with currants that I love!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2363" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 42" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-42.jpg" width="1500" height="758" /></p>
<p>Organic whole milk and a wonderful variety of <a href="http://www.villamyriam.com/">Villa Myriam</a> loose leaf tea.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2364" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 43" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-43.jpg" width="1500" height="570" /></p>
<p>Fresh squeezed orange and apple juice. </p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2365" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 44" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-44.jpg" width="1500" height="1183" /></p>
<p>Hand painted window pane between the dining and kitchen by which we could expect to see the daily local and national newspapers each morning.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2366" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 45" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-45.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>I hate to be redundant, but have I emphasized that I love the <a href="http://www.lospoblanos.com/thefarmshop/catalog/food/los-poblanos-housemade-granola">Los Poblanos housemade granola</a> yet? And that fresh fruit is amazing too!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2367" alt="Los Poblanos Albuquerque New Mexico Wedding Photographer 46" src="https://googledrive.com/host/0B2YHeCssXjxzdERmSjFHS3g3Rnc/Los-Poblanos-Albuquerque-New-Mexico-Wedding-Photographer-46.jpg" width="1500" height="1066" /></p>
<p>A dainty little lemon curd pastry to go with my coffee, please.</p>

<p>Eggs benedict Los Poblanos style. Not only was it perfectly done and perfectly presented, and perfectly filling too. </p>

<p>The second entree had a bit more of a distinct New Mexican flair--chilaquiles--strips of corn tortilla with fresh chile sauce, and cheese, topped with a fried egg and their own microgreens, a side of sausage, and a ah-so-soft tortilla to wrap it all up with.</p>

<p>I was soaking in the sun while reading a little bit more about Los Poblanos property, specifically about <a href="http://www.lospoblanos.com/events-and-weddings/">La Quinta Cultural Center</a>, where we about to explore. </p>
<p>[<a href="http://www.lospoblanos.com/about/history/">from Los Poblanos' website</a>] La Quinta Cultural Center was designed and used for civil, social, and cultural purposes. The art gallery held frequent exhibitions, which were open to the public. The ballroom and catering kitchen were designed to host meetings, lectures, and concerts for up to 200 people. It was the original home to the June Music Festival and boasted the first swimming pool in Albuquerque, complete with men’s and women’s changing rooms painted by Paul Lantz. A lecture series began in 1937, where Thornton Wilder, Rockwell Kent, Elmer Rice, and Paul Horgan were some of the speakers.</p>
<p>Using La Quinta as headquarters for their cultural and educational endeavors, Ruth and Albert Simms founded Manzano Day School, Sandia Prep, Albuquerque Academy, and Albuquerque Little Theater. The impact these institutions have had on New Mexico is immeasurable.</p>
<p>There are many books and articles written about the architectural significance of Los Poblanos and La Quinta. John Gaw Meem has long been considered New Mexico’s most important architect, but he is now recognized internationally for his contribution to 20th century architecture. Architects have visited from all over the world with the sole purpose of studying John Gaw Meem and the buildings of Los Poblanos specifically. His work at Los Poblanos is best summed up by James Moore, Former Director, The Albuquerque Museum:</p>
<p>“Speaking from my background in art history, I would say that La Quinta is not only perhaps the most important structure in the North Valley, but is one of New Mexico’s invaluable treasures. John Gaw Meem is without question the quintessential New Mexico architect of the early and mid 20th century and…La Quinta is one of his most important, if not the most important, projects of his career in this state.”</p>

<p>Note the painted tile emblem above my head that says La Quinta A|R. A and R standing for Albert and Ruth Simms, who reassembled the ranch in 1930s. </p>
<p>[<a href="http://www.lospoblanos.com/about/history/">from Los Poblanos' website</a>] Los Poblanos today encompasses the original headquarters of the 800-acre ranch owned by the Congressman, Albert Simms, and his wife, Ruth Hannah McCormick Simms that extended to the crest of the Sandia Mountains. Our historic inn was their private residence and the center of operations of their dairy, farming, nursery, art businesses, and dynamic cultural and educational endeavors. In 1932, Ruth Hanna McCormick Simms commissioned architect John Gaw Meem and numerous WPA artists and craftsmen to renovate the ranch house and create the Cultural Center for political and community events and recreation with gardens designed by Rose Greeley.</p>

<p>We were invited to self tour through La Quinta. The friendly kitchen staff let us in and answered our questions. They even showed us the women’s changing rooms painted by Paul Lant, which were used back in the day when the La Quinta swimming pool was in use, but are now used by the kitchen staff for personal belongings. </p>
