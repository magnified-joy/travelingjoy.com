<p>Many people say to me, "I didn't know you are a dancer!" Yes, I am. Sometimes time passes, but once a dancer, always a dancer. (Now forgive my poor dance genre titles as I explain my dance background.) I grew up with gymanastics-dance in elementary school, park & rec-dance in middle school, competitive-dance in high school, interpretative-dance in college, and even social (ballroom/latin)-dance in college and beyond. But it wasn't until I found "spiritual-dance" that I really found my body + spirit connected in a whole new way. Not that I wasn't "connected" before, but something changed starting in high school when I began to realize that physical movement could (and should!) have a spiritual element, a sweet way of connecting with our inner beings and connecting with God, our Creator of all art and movement. I also started realizing that movement could be used in the context of a shared space with other dancers, as well as with the audience at large. When I started to intentionally bring my dance movement before my Creator, I felt so much more alive! Movement was no longer merely about performance for an unknown audience, having a perfectly polished piece (like that competitive-dance in high school), or even comparing myself to the dancers around me. Movement was a sweet expression of the soul. Creative movement stirred my own emotions but also evoked the emotions of others. </p>
<p>Even though dance defined me growing up, I left it at some point after college... Perhaps I got discouraged, frustrated, or started comparing myself to others again. Perhaps I got caught up in the mundane tasks of adulthood, trying to find a job in my field or worrying about when I would finally be free from college loans. Perhaps I lost an intentional studio or dance space and even my living room didn't seem like a suitable place for some creative movement. Nonetheless, my art, my creative passion, my yearning to dance was still inside of me. I knew that "spiritual-dance" was still in me, just waiting for a time, a space, and a little bit of encouragement to be released again. </p>
<p>That's exactly what this featured dance is for me. "Bread and Wine" by <a href="http://joshgarrels.com/">Josh Garrels</a> is a story about communion. Communion with God, communion with others...and even (my own interpretation), communion of the body + spirit in creative, worshipful movement. I was SO thankful that Mariah LeFeber asked me to join a few other women (also post-college women who had previously danced too) from our church community to explore some intentional movement together. We first got together to listen to Josh's song, reflect, pray, and then move with our bodies. Together, we choreographed a dance and encouraged each other in seeking this Communion. We were privileged to be able to perform "Bread + Wine" live with Josh Garrels, when he came as a feature artist to the <a href="http://blackhawkpulse.com/">Pulse Arts Conference</a> in March 2013. This was the "spiritual-dance" that I longed for. The dance was so meaningful and powerful for us, the little community of dancers, and for the audience. </p>
<p>Even though months passed and our busy lives kept us from dancing together, we made it a point to share "Bread and Wine" to the Blackhawk Church community again during a Sunday evening service. After almost a year apart, we got together to dance again, and we were still able to fluidly move together again. Another example of this Communion in action. Read Josh's lyrics and watch our dance. May you, too, experience a little but of my heart for dance, for God, for life that is meant to be shared together. "All I have I give to you if you will share your sorrows too, Then joy will be the crown upon our heads, My friend"</p>

<p>"Bread and Wine" original song and lyrics by Josh Garrels</p>
<p>I was wrong, everybody needs someone, to hold on<br />
Take my hand, I’ve been a lonesome man, took a while to understand </p>
<p>There's some things we can’t live without,<br />
A man’s so prone to doubt,<br />
Faithful are the wounds from friends.<br />
So give it just a little time,<br />
Share some bread and wine<br />
Weave your heart into mine,<br />
My friend </p>
<p>Walls fall down, where there’s a peaceful sound, lonely souls hang around<br />
Don’t be shy, there’s nothing left to hide, come on let’s talk a while </p>
<p>Of the places we left behind,<br />
No longer yours and mine<br />
But we could build a good thing here too<br />
So give it just a little time,<br />
Share bread and wine<br />
Weave your heart into mine </p>
<p>If I fall, I fall alone, but two can help to bear the load<br />
A threefold chord is hard to break<br />
All I have I give to you if you will share your sorrows too,<br />
Then joy will be the crown upon our heads<br />
My friend</p>
