<p>We absolutely love camping and the outdoors. We are also foodies. Although we don’t bring “everything but kitchen sink” with us camping (that’d be silly) we do know how to cook up a mad meal while camping. This is not to impress anyone. We just love food. We love good food. And camping just makes it all the more challenging and fun.</p>

<p>We decided to try our hand at cooking salmon directly on the grill rather than the safe and easy way, in aluminum foil. After all, we are creative artists not just in our wedding photography, but in our cooking as well. </p>
<p>Of course we were inspired by the products we had on hand--that being the fresh Lake Michigan salmon that we had just caught the previous week on <a href="http://weddings.magnifiedjoy.com/life/door-county-wedding-photographer-algoma-wi-salmon-charter-fishing/">our annual charter fishing trip with the family</a>. We had also just flipped through an issue <a href="http://kinfolk.com/">Kinfolk magazine</a>, a publication for young foodies and adventure seekers, where we stumbled upon a simple “Campfire Salmon”. Little did we know this salmon was going to be the best salmon we’ve ever made!</p>
<p>En Tao sprinkled the sea salt, sugar, and fresh dill onto the beautiful pink flesh and let the flavors infuse for a couple of hours. Once the filets had a bit of time to take on their flavors, En Tao simply grilled them directly over the campfire, allowing the campfire smoke to give them a naturally smoked flavor and the campfire grill to leave their skins with a crispy interwoven design. </p>

<p>We finished the salmon filets off with a little bit of butter and lemon and served them with Maria’s finely chopped kale salad. Mmm, so good. The salt, smoke, dill, lemon and butter juices combined to make each bite of the fish so moist and flavorful. I do have to say our campfire salmon far exceeds any salmon that we’ve ordered at a restaurant. </p>

<p>On the side, we made a caprese salad with all local ingredients--Cesar’s Mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes, and fresh basil--what a treat!</p>

<p>We had spontaneously picked up several ears of corn from a farmer’s roadside stand on the way to the park. The slow campfire-roasted corn on the cob turned out to be the sweetest--a fine dessert replacement while camping!</p>

We regret to say that our tent did not see enough campsites in 2013, but we were so happy that we made the time to at least explore a new <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/rocheacri/">Wisconsin State Park--Roche a Cri</a>, we’ll be back to visit again!</p>
<p>We find inspiration in the outdoors; <a href="http://weddings.magnifiedjoy.com/life/mercer-wi-northwoods-minocqua-wedding-photographer-annual-autumn-artist-retreat/">follow us to our artist retreat as well</a>.</p>
