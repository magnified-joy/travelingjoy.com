<p>Year 2013 is huge for us! We are in the process of re-starting our business through creating a whole new branding--a unified and memorable experience for all of our clients. We are excited to share with you all some of our big changes--our new website (you’re looking at it right now), our new logo, our new business cards, and new photo delivery method!</p>

<p>We’re noticing that computers are starting to phase out CD/DVD drives. In light of our changing technology needs, we are excited to announce that we are now going to be delivering photos in two media methods--our customized DVDs along with our brand new engraved wood USB drives.</p>

<p>I feel that the wood tone really speaks for our style. We’re all about capturing the simple intrinsic beauty in people!</p>

<p>And here’s a look at our new business cards too! <a href="http://www.moo.com">Moo</a> did a great job with our cards! I like working with them as they give personalized attention to their customers. Even their packaging of their business cards is classy cute!</p>

<p>The texture of the paper on our new business cards is really nice too. Think quality linen feel.</p>
