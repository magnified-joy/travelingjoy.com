<p><em>Mr. Governor Nelson,</p>
<p><em>We have driven past your lands several times. In fact, more than just several times, considering it is in our neighborhood. We even bought a State Park pass sticker for our windshield so that we could come visit your Park whenever we wanted. But, I regret to inform you that we haven’t until now. Our visit is long overdue and we are extremely sorry. I do want to inform you, however, that we find your Park to be delightfully beautiful for an afternoon stroll. Your trails are beautiful, easy to navigate and lead right to the Lake Mendota waterfront. Your beach is perfectly groomed for the beach volleyball players and the paragliders. We thoroughly enjoyed watching the paragliders get suited up, strapped in, and lifted away by the Lake Mendota wind and waves. Although we didn’t plan ahead for a picnic, we think that your picnic grounds are stellar and next time we will bring some charcoal, local corn on the cob or other seasonal veggies, and some grassfed beef, and invite our friends to have a tasty grill-out by the lake.</em></p>
<p><em>Although you past from this earth right before I started studying at our alma mater, the great UW, in 2005, I am grateful for your work in our fine city as well as representing us in the Senate. We appreciate your care for creation in establishing Earth Day for our nation to bring awareness to the stewardship of our earth. We hope to continue to explore and enjoy your Park in our great home of Madison. Perhaps you’ll see us next on one of the amateur paraglider opportunities at your beach or maybe we’ll even host our next engagement shoot at your Park!</em></p>
<p>With Joy,<br />
Maria</em></p>
